# Authentication UI 

A **modern frontend authentication system UI** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, simulating real-world authentication flows such as signup, login, OTP verification, and password reset.

This is a **frontend-only demo** (OTP is mocked for learning purposes).

│── index.html (Login)
│── signup.html (Signup)
│── otp.html (OTP Verification)
│── forgot.html (Forgot Password)

## How Authentication Works (Demo)

- User signs up → OTP is generated and shown via alert
- OTP is stored temporarily in `localStorage`
- OTP verification redirects user to login
- Login sets a session flag in `localStorage`
- Dashboard is protected from direct access

## Important Note

This project **does not send real emails or SMS**.

> In real-world applications, OTP and password handling must be done securely using a backend (Node.js, Firebase, etc.).

---

## Resume Description

> Designed and implemented a frontend authentication UI featuring signup, login, OTP verification, password visibility toggle, password strength validation, and session-based route protection using localStorage.

## Future Enhancements

- Real OTP using Node.js + Nodemailer
- Password hashing with bcrypt
